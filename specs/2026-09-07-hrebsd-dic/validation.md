# HREBSD-DIC -- `hrebsd-dic`: validation

**Status note (requirements D19): drafted 2026-09-07 with ZERO test
execution and ZERO measurement** -- the spec stage is read-only
analysis plus `specs/` writes. Every tolerance marked `MTP`
(measured-then-pinned) is filled at the owning stage's
failing-tests/implementation gates (`pytest.approx(measured,
rel=0.05)` or the ~2x margin convention on misorientation/strain
bands); this file ships with placeholder language and an
intentionally near-empty "Recorded results" ledger. **No PR-gated
CI protects this code** (branch policy, plan section 1) --
pushes of the branch DO trigger the fork's on-push full-matrix CI
(`.github/workflows/tests.yml:22-29`; corrected 2026-09-07 at
spec review, an earlier draft wrongly claimed no CI run ever
exercises this code), recorded as an extra signal only, per the
plan section 1 push policy: every gate below
is a LOCAL gate, recorded here with numbers, recipes and the
machine ID (the Recorded results discipline of
`specs/2026-09-07-spherical-gpu/validation.md`). Tests marked
[download] need pooch + network once (cached after); everything
else is pure Python on shipped/synthetic data.

Oracle-first principle (requirements, Reference-implementation
status): there is no binary ground truth -- EMHREBSDDIC was never
built here and its pipeline is WIP -- so validation rests on
synthetic oracles whose expected answers are known EXACTLY by
construction, plus one real-data noise-floor benchmark. GND is
validated against the mathematics, never against another code's
sign conventions (D14.1).

## Automated (default suite; run from Git Bash)

```
uv run pytest tests/test_indexing tests/test_signals -k "hrebsd" -n 4
```

(one `-n 0` run first per stage that adds a numba kernel.)

### V0 -- Interpolation kernel (`tests/test_indexing/test_hrebsd_interpolation.py`) -- Stage A

- `test_kernel_matches_map_coordinates`: numba bicubic evaluation
  of spline-filtered coefficients equals
  `scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates(order=3, prefilter=False,
  mode="mirror")` to <= 1e-12 relative on random interior points,
  random images, BOTH sides on f64 coefficients (scoped
  2026-09-07, spec review: `map_coordinates` on f32 input
  computes and returns f32, so 1e-12 is unreachable there). The
  f32 coefficient-storage arm (D17) is compared against the same
  f64 reference under its own bound `KERNEL_F32_TOL` (MTP,
  measured alongside the D17 dtype A/B; f32-ULP class expected).
  [D3/D17]
- `test_kernel_py_func`: the same through `.py_func`
  (tech-stack.md:49). [D3/D18]
- `test_gradient_kernels_match_spline_derivative`: analytic
  gradient planes vs `map_coordinates` derivative-of-spline
  reference. [D3]
- `test_mirror_boundary`: near-edge evaluations match the mirror
  reference; no extrapolation blow-up. [D3]

### V1 -- Algebraic round trips (`test_hrebsd_homography.py`) -- Stage A

- `test_shape_function_compose_invert`: `W(h) W(h)^-1 = I`;
  composition associativity; `W33` renormalization idempotent.
  [D2]
- `test_h_fe_round_trip`: `fe_to_homography(homography_to_fe(h,
  PC, DD), PC, DD) == h` to 1e-12 for random h, random PC/DD
  (both corner-origin and PC-centered forms); and the reverse
  composition for random reduced Fe. Machine-precision class, no
  MTP. [D6]
- `test_pure_cases_closed_form`: pure translation, pure in-plane
  rotation, pure isotropic dilation map to their closed-form
  homographies and back. [D2/D6]
- `test_direction_pinned_once`: the D2 warp direction tested in
  BOTH compositions on one synthetic case; the passing direction
  asserted, the failing direction asserted to fail (the
  sign-maze killer; run once, then frozen). [D2]

### V2 -- Synthetic warp-refit oracle (`test_hrebsd_engine.py`) -- Stage A

The core oracle (EMsoftOO's own dev recipe, `play2.f90`,
reproduced in Python): warp a real reference pattern by a known
homography with an INDEPENDENT warper
(`skimage.transform.ProjectiveTransform` + `warp`, test-only
import, D18), refit with the engine, compare `h_fit` to `h_true`.

- `test_warp_refit_small_h_480`: 480x480 synthetic-projection
  reference (V3 helper) or upsampled real pattern; a batch of
  random small homographies (translations to +-5 px, rotations to
  1 deg, strains to 2e-3); recovery metric (re-defined
  2026-09-07, spec review): the D2.5 corner displacement of the
  ERROR warp `W(h_true)^-1 . W(h_fit)` over the SR corners --
  one number in px, unit-consistent across all 8 dofs (raw
  `max|h_fit - h_true|` mixes dimensionless, px and 1/px
  components and is not used) -- <=
  `WARP_REFIT_TOL_480` (MTP; drafting seed <= 0.1 px noise-free:
  the cross-interpolator systematic ~0.01-0.05 px, theory report
  section 6 oracle 2, bounds it below, with the ~2x margin
  convention). [D2/D3/D5]
- `test_intensity_scale_invariance` (added 2026-09-07, spec
  review): one V2 case re-run with `ref -> c*ref`,
  `tar -> c'*tar` for `c, c'` powers of two (2**-10, 2**10):
  fitted h BITWISE identical (IEEE scaling is exact for
  power-of-two factors through the linear preprocessing, ZMN and
  the matched D2.1/D2.3 H/g pairing); one generic-factor case
  agrees to a machine-precision-class band. Kills any mismatched
  H/g normalization (which scales the step by an
  intensity-dependent factor and spuriously converges at the
  seed). [D2]
- `test_warp_refit_60px`: same on `nickel_ebsd_small` 60x60
  patterns, looser MTP band (qualitative regime, recorded). [D2]
- `test_convergence_metadata`: iterations < `max_iterations`,
  `converged` True, `norm_dp < min_step` on the batch; a
  deliberately unreachable `min_step=1e-12` case exits at the cap
  with `converged=False` and NaN downstream props. [D2.5-6]
- `test_seed_required_for_large_translation`: a +-15 px
  translation case fails from identity seeding and succeeds with
  the phase-XC seed (kills a dropped-seed mutant, pins D5's
  reason for existing). [D5]
- `test_dtype_ab_harness` (measurement harness, Stage A gate):
  f32 vs f64 coefficient storage on the V2 batch; verdict pinned
  per D17 and recorded below. [D17]
- `test_two_runs_bitwise`: identical inputs + chunking give
  bitwise-identical props (grain-ordering restoration, D16). [D16]
- `test_border_and_dead_band`: SR excludes the border and the
  cross; a warped feature outside the SR does not influence the
  fit (planted-defect test). [D4]
- `test_get_map_data_2d_prop_pin`: the D15.7 verification on the
  installed orix, result recorded. [D15]

### V3 -- Deformed-master end-to-end oracle (`test_hrebsd_deformed_master.py`) -- Stage A engine half, Stage B tensor half

The primary end-to-end oracle. Test-local projection helper
reimplements `EBSDMasterPattern.get_patterns`' geometry with an
imposed deformation: obtain detector direction cosines (kikuchipy
internals `_get_direction_cosines_*`), rotate to the crystal
frame, left-multiply `F^-1`, renormalize, interpolate the Lambert
master -- EMsoft's own `applyDeformation` mechanism
(`mod_EBSD.f90:3553, 3570`). Because the engine's geometric model
and this simulation are the same first-order model, the expected
homography is EXACT: `h_expected = fe_to_homography(R_chain(F),
PC, DD)` with the D7 frame chain minded (theory report section
6.3).

- `test_deformed_master_homography_recovery`: impose a set of F
  (pure strains ~1e-3, pure rotations to 2 deg, mixed, incl. an F
  built with sigma33 = 0 from a chosen e and C); recovered h
  within `DEFORMED_MASTER_H_TOL` (MTP) of exact; at 480x480
  detector from the shipped Ni Lambert master
  (`nickel_ebsd_master_pattern_small`, both hemispheres). [D2-D7]
- `test_deformed_master_strain_recovery` (Stage B): through
  `hrebsd_strain_stress` with the matching stiffness, at a
  GENERIC (low-symmetry-position) crystal orientation (added
  2026-09-07, spec review: a symmetric orientation would leave
  the crystal->sample stiffness-rotation direction unexercised;
  companion to the D9.5 C16' transpose pin): per-
  component strain error <= `DEFORMED_MASTER_STRAIN_TOL` (MTP;
  drafting seed <= 2e-4 per component at 480^2), recovered `e33`
  matches the built-in sigma33 = 0 value (the closure killer),
  `sigma33` ~ 0 self-check. [D8/D9/D10]
- `test_traction_free_vs_deviatoric_differ`: the two closures give
  measurably different e33 on a non-deviatoric F (kills a
  fallback-always mutant). [D9]

### V4 -- Pure-rotation analytic cases (`test_hrebsd_rotation.py`) -- Stage A frames, Stage B split

- `test_in_plane_rotation`: pure rotation about the detector
  normal at 0.1-5 deg (deformed-master patterns): recovered
  homography matches the closed in-plane form; polar R matches
  axis/angle to `ROTATION_TOL` (MTP; seed <= 1e-5 rad); strain
  leakage <= `ROTATION_STRAIN_LEAK` (MTP; seed <= 1e-4 up to
  5 deg). [D1/D2/D7/D8]
- `test_out_of_plane_tilt`: small rotation about detector x:
  leading terms land in h23/h32 as the exact `fe_to_homography`
  predicts (translation ~ -omega*DD, perspective ~ omega/DD);
  THE detector-frame axis/sign pin of D1.5/D7 -- the recovered
  axis must be the imposed sample-frame axis through
  `sample_to_detector`. [D1/D7]
- `test_rotation_sweep_capture_range` (recorded, not gated): sweep
  0.5-12 deg; record the largest angle the translation-only seed
  converges from (D5's recorded capture range; Ruggles 2018's
  benchmark design). [D5]
- `test_small_strain_fast_path_equality` (Stage B, measurement
  harness): polar vs small-strain paths over the sweep; the D8 MTP
  equality threshold and enable-angle recorded. [D8]

### V5 -- Si-wafer noise-floor benchmark -- Stage B [download], parts weekly

`kp.data.si_wafer()` (50x50 map, 480x480 px, single-crystal
nominally strain-free Si; `_data.py:321-440`); pooch-gated, skips
cleanly without the `tests` extra (tech-stack.md:16).

- `test_si_noise_floor_default_route`: default knobs, auto
  reference (Stage B): per-component strain std and rotation std
  recorded; the pinned regression band `SI_STRAIN_FLOOR` (MTP;
  literature context 1e-4..2e-4 class at 480 px -- recorded, not
  presumed) guards regressions thereafter. [D2-D9]
- `test_si_kam_floor`: HR-KAM noise floor in mrad recorded +
  pinned (theory expectation sigma_omega * sqrt(2/N) ~ 0.05-0.1
  mrad class). [D12]
- `test_si_gnd_floor` (Stage C): scalar GND floor recorded vs the
  4-8e12 m^-2 literature scale. [D14]
- Preprocessing/border/KAM-order sweeps (plan open questions 2-4,
  10): measurement harnesses, weekly-marked, results recorded
  below and defaults re-pinned only with dated amendments.
- `test_si_pc_shift_plane`: `hrebsd_pc_shift` residuals near-zero
  mean when the per-point PC from `extrapolate_pc` is used;
  plane-fit comparison recorded. [D13]

### V6 -- PC-shift phantom oracle (`test_hrebsd_pc_shift.py`) -- Stage A geometry, Stage B function

- `test_phantom_uncorrected`: identity-F deformed-master patterns
  generated on a per-point-PC grid (each pattern projected with
  its own `extrapolate_pc` PC): with the D6.2 correction DISABLED
  (private switch), the fitted homographies equal the closed-form
  phantom in the spec's OWN reference-PC-centered frame
  (D6.2: translation `gamma = delta = PC_t - PC_ref` px, scaling
  `alpha_s` = the DD ratio) to
  `PC_PHANTOM_TOL` (MTP). THE sign pin of D6.3 -- the passing
  sign set is recorded in requirements D6 with the date. [D6]
- `test_phantom_corrected`: correction ENABLED: `Fe = I`
  everywhere to the interpolation floor; strain phantom killed.
  [D6]
- `test_phantom_corrected_through_stage_b` (Stage B; added
  2026-09-07, spec review): the corrected per-point-PC phantom
  fed THROUGH `hrebsd_strain_stress`: strain ~ 0 everywhere at
  the interpolation floor -- kills a Stage B re-application of
  the D6.2 correction (the stored `Fe` is already corrected,
  plan 3.2), which V3's single-PC geometry cannot see. [D6/D8]
- `test_single_pc_equals_per_point_pc`: a single-PC detector +
  internal `extrapolate_pc` gives the same result as the
  explicit per-point detector built from the same model
  (D6.1 equivalence). [D6]
- `test_pc_shift_function` (Stage B): `hrebsd_pc_shift` returns
  the frozen dict keys; residuals ~ 0 on the phantom set;
  miscalibrated-PC case shows the documented nonzero-mean
  signature. [D13]

### V7 -- Constant-curvature GND + KAM oracle (`test_hrebsd_gnd.py`) -- Stage B KAM, Stage C GND

- `test_alpha_from_analytic_beta`: build a synthetic beta field
  with constant lattice curvature (e.g. omega_3(x1) = kappa*x1):
  the implemented `alpha` components equal the analytic constant
  alpha to < 1 % (pure math, no patterns; validated against the
  DERIVATION, frozen never-against-another-code rule). Single-
  component cases for EACH computed alpha entry, per assumption
  tier (reworded 2026-09-07, spec review): the three exact
  `alpha_i3` (D14.1) and the six d/dx3-neglect entries
  `alpha_i1`/`alpha_i2` (D14.2 beta route) that feed "a5"/"a9".
  The structural assertion is that NO d/dx3 derivative term is
  ever fabricated (the k = 3 derivative slots are identically
  absent/zero in the construction) and that each estimator
  consumes exactly its D14.4 documented set -- NOT that entries
  are "absent from every estimator" (a9 legitimately consumes
  all nine of its documented construction). [D14]
- `test_estimator_prefactors`: 30/10, 30/14, 30/20 literal pins;
  scalar rho = estimator formula on hand-built alpha. [D14]
- `test_antisymmetry_fix_detector_frame`: on a synthetic beta with
  distinct beta13/23 vs beta31/32, the fix replaces the latter
  with the negated former IN THE DETECTOR FRAME (order-of-
  operations pin vs rotation to sample frame); stress path
  unaffected. [D14.3]
- `test_kam_constant_curvature` (Stage B): 1st-order HR-KAM on a
  linear-along-a-grid-axis rotation field equals the
  KERNEL-DERIVED expectation `(6/8) * kappa * step` for the
  frozen all-8-neighbor mean (D12's corrected identity,
  2026-09-07 spec review: the test computes the expectation from
  the kernel offsets -- asserting `kappa * step` would fail a
  correct implementation by the fixed 25 % kernel-geometry
  factor); grain-mask and psi_max guards; mrad units pinned
  literally (a radians-vs-mrad mutant dies here). [D12]
- `test_gnd_end_to_end_curvature` (Stage C): the curvature field
  imposed through deformed-master patterns; recovered rho within
  `GND_E2E_TOL` (MTP) of the analytic density. [D14]
- `test_nan_safety`: grain boundaries, map edges, non-converged
  points produce NaN, never fabricated gradients. [D14.5]

### Stage B unit suites (`test_hrebsd_tensors.py`, `test_hrebsd_segmentation.py`, `test_hrebsd_kam.py`)

- Polar/strain/closure/Bond-rotation/voigt_stiffness/derived-map
  pins per plan 3.1 (analytic, no MTP except where marked).
- `segment_grains`: synthetic two-grain map, one-point grain,
  unindexed -1, connectivity 1 vs 2, threshold boundary case
  (>= vs > mutant), label determinism (row-major first-seen).
  [D11]
- Auto-reference: argmax IQ, tie -> lowest flat index; explicit
  `(row, col)` and per-grain index modes; `reference="auto"`
  NotImplementedError pin in Stage A, replaced in Stage B. [D11]

### Signal-method suite (`tests/test_signals/test_ebsd_hrebsd_dic.py`)

- Frozen-signature/defaults dict pin (the Phase 8 convention);
  masks polarity; lazy input -> eager output; props
  presence/dtype/shape per D15.6; xmap orientations unchanged;
  single-phase stress guard (D9.6); info message includes the
  memory note (D16). [D15/D16]

## Local-gated and weekly

- [download] V5 Si-wafer suite (above): default-suite smoke subset
  on a `[::5, ::5]` sub-grid; full 50x50 map + the sweep
  harnesses `@pytest.mark.weekly`.
- Weekly: V2 warp-refit at 960x960 (upsampled projection,
  Ruggles-2018-scale check, recorded); the D3 bicubic-vs-quintic
  A/B re-run; full-map performance rows (Performance table).
- Local oldest-matrix run once per stage (plan section 1 recipe,
  incl. the scikit-image 0.21.0 pin and the test_signals paths),
  result recorded below -- the recorded oldest-floor gate (the
  on-push CI oldest job is an extra signal only, plan section 1).

## Manual

- User review of the plan-0 constitution amendments at the spec
  commit (the spec-stage verify step; approval gate per the
  autonomous-mode memory is waived for spherical phases only, so
  HREBSD stage boundaries surface to the user).
- Tutorial renders + nbval passes locally (Stage C); map gallery
  eyeballed against the OpenXY "usual maps" checklist, carried
  INLINE here (2026-09-07, spec review: the theory-report
  scratchpad does not survive the session, so the checklist a
  gate consumes must live in the spec). Each item covered or
  dispositioned:
  - strain components e11..e33 -- D8/D15.6 `strain` prop,
    tutorial gallery.
  - stress: von Mises, principal s1/s2/s3 (+ hydrostatic) --
    D10.
  - rotation maps (vector components/magnitude) -- D8;
    misorientation-kernel map = HR-KAM -- D12.
  - dislocation density, total (3/5/9-component) -- D14.
  - split (per-type) dislocation density -- OUT of v1, deferred
    with the L1 split (Scope; plan open question 7).
  - tetragonality -- OUT of v1 with its revisit path recorded in
    Scope (derivable from the stored `Fe` prop).
  - Burgers-vector maps -- OUT of v1, part of the per-type split
    deferral (Scope).
  - misorientation maps, IPF, IQ -- existing kikuchipy/orix
    functionality, demonstrated in the tutorial, nothing new
    built.
  - ROI shifts -- the DIC analogue is D13's
    translation/model/residual maps.
  - SSE/fit-metric maps -- the D10 quality maps
    (`residual`/`num_iterations`/`norm_dp`/`converged`).
- One end-user smoke run from a notebook on the Si wafer:
  `hrebsd_dic` + `hrebsd_strain_stress` + maps, eyeballing that a
  nominally strain-free wafer shows noise, not structure.

## Definition of done

- Per stage: failing tests committed first; implementation;
  adversarial review (both reviewers + the stage's mutation list)
  + fixes; `pre-commit run --files` clean; coverage 100 % of the
  stage's `_hrebsd/` modules with the command output recorded;
  full existing suite green (`uv run pytest tests -n 4`, recorded);
  local oldest-matrix run recorded; signed commits pushed to
  `origin/hrebsd-dic`; roadmap stage boxes ticked. NO PR into
  `develop` (branch policy) -- "PR opened/merged" gates are
  REPLACED by "pushed to origin/hrebsd-dic + roadmap ticked".
- **The three spec documents submitted to adversarial review**
  (fidelity/theory + conventions/integration) with findings folded
  by the fixer before the spec commit is finalized -- the
  spec-stage workflow of the approved plan; the disposition table
  is appended to plan.md (Phase 8 precedent).
- Every `MTP` placeholder replaced by a dated measured value in
  Recorded results (recipe + machine ID); the D2/D6 sign pins, D3
  order decision and D17 dtype verdict recorded in requirements
  with dates.
- Plan section 6 open questions resolved or their conservative
  defaults confirmed by the named measurements, each with a dated
  record.
- All six public names + the `EBSD.hrebsd_dic` method exported,
  documented, in the API reference; tutorial registered and
  nbval-wired (Stage C); CHANGELOG entries present (fork-only
  wording per plan 4.4).
- Si-wafer noise floors (strain, rotation, KAM, GND) recorded --
  the feature's headline honesty numbers, quoted in the tutorial
  at 480x480 only, with 60x60 results labeled qualitative.

## Recorded results

Append-only ledger. Every entry is dated, names the machine (CPU
class + OS at minimum; the drafting machine is the 20-core Windows
11 laptop of the spherical phases), the exact recipe or script
name with its command, and which `MTP` placeholder or decision it
fills. Refutations of frozen decisions are recorded here AND
amended in requirements.md with the same date (Phase 8/10
precedent).

### 2026-09-07 (drafting)

No measurements: the spec stage was read-only analysis plus
`specs/` writes (requirements D19). All EMsoftOO/OpenXY/kikuchipy
behaviour cited in the spec was verified by line reading only
(emsoftoo_report.md, kikuchipy_surface_report.md,
theory_maps_report.md; scratchpad reports do not survive the
session -- every load-bearing citation is carried inline in
requirements.md). This section is filled at each stage's
failing-tests gate (placeholder inventory), implementation gate
(measurements + pins, with recipes), and review gate
(re-measurements), each in its own dated subsection.
